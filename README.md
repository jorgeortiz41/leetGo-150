## This is only for practice (currently learning Go)

Problems marked with \* means i solved it with help of ChatGPT and still need further understanding.

- [x] 88. [Merge Sorted Array](/mergeSortedArray.go)
- [x] 27. [Remove Element](/removeElement.go)
- [x] 26. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](/removeDupes.go)
- [x] 80. [Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](/removeDupes2.go)
- [x] 169. [Majority Element](/majorityElement.go)
- [x] 189. [Rotate Array](/rotateArray.go)\*
- [x] 121. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](/maxProfit.go)\*
- [x] 122. [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](/maxProfit2.go)\*
- [x] 55. [Jump Game](/jumpGame.go)\*
- [x] 45. [Jump Game II](/jumpGame2.go)\*
- [x] 274. [H-Index](/hIndex.go)
  - Tested 2 solutions and experimented with goroutines for the tests to measure time.
  - On average hIndex() is 24x faster than hIndex2() for **larger inputs**.
- [x] 380. [Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)](/randomizedSet.go)\*\*
  - Technically works, in leetcode it says wrong answer on an input with hundreds of getRandom() calls.
  - The numbers are shown randomly and are not incorrect. Leetcode doesnt say why its wrong
- [x] 238. [Product of Array Except Self](/productExceptSelf.go)\*
- [x] 134. [Gas Station](/canCompleteCircuit.go)
- [ ] 135. Candy
